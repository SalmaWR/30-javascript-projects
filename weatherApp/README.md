## Overview

This repository is part of the **Great Stack Challenge** where the goal is to build 30 JavaScript projects, each focusing on different aspects of web development. The projects will help you:
- Master core JavaScript concepts.
- Work with APIs, UI interactions, and animations.
- Implement popular frameworks and libraries.

You’ll be building real-world applications ranging from simple mini-apps to more complex, fully functional projects.

## Technologies

Throughout these projects, we will use a variety of tools and frameworks:

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5** & **CSS3**
- **React** (for building dynamic user interfaces)
Additional libraries and frameworks may be introduced based on the project’s needs.
